## Introduction

In the [previous article](https://xrdocs.io/ncs5500/tutorials/acl-s-on-ncs5500-bvi-interfaces/), we discussed the ACLs on NCS5500 BVI interfaces. We covered the ACL implementation and support for IPv4 and IPv6 ACLs in both ingress and egress directions. We also discussed the enhancements w.r.t IPv6 Egress ACLs. In this article we discuss the overall implementation of IPv6 Egress ACLs across NCS5500 product family (J/J+ and J2).
