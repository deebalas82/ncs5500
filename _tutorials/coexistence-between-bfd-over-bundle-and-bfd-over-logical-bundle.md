## Introduction

In the previous articles, we introduced the concepts of [BFD over Bundle](https://xrdocs.io/ncs5500/tutorials/bfd-over-bundle-interfaces-on-ncs5500-and-ncs500/) and [BFD over Logical Bundle](https://xrdocs.io/ncs5500/tutorials/multipath-and-multihop-bfd-sessions-on-ncs5500-and-ncs500/). We saw the configurations and the use cases. In this article we will discuss the limitations of both and see the why we need their coexistence.
