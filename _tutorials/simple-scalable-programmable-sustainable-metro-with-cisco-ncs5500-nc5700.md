## Introduction

As per [Cisco's Annual Internet Report](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/executive-perspectives/annual-internet-report/white-paper-c11-741490.html), the number of devices connected to IP networks will be more than three times the global population by 2023. There will be 3.6 networked devices per capita by 2023, up from 2.4 networked devices per capita in 2018. There will be 29.3 billion networked devices by 2023, up from 18.4 billion in 2018. As per Gartner, by 2025 more than 75% of the computing data needs to be analyzed, processed, and stored near to the end users. New paradigms such as 5G introduction, video traffic continuous growth, IoT proliferation and cloud services model require unprecedented flexibility, elasticity and scale from the network. Increasing bandwidth demands and decreasing ARPU put pressure on reducing network cost. At the same time, services need to be deployed faster and more cost effectively to stay competitive. The metro network becomes the key to this transformation where we see services getting terminated and end users are looking for better experiences. In this article, we will discuss latest trends in the metro architecture and how to communication service providers (CSPs) can design their network for optimised value proposition.

## Metro Architecture Trends

We are seeing a [major architecture shift](https://blogs.cisco.com/sp/catching-the-next-wave-of-innovation-in-routing-and-automation) in the way the new metro fabric is evolving. Applications (8K Video, Gaming, AR/VR) are becoming more dynamic requiring differentiated user experiences and optimizing distributed compute and decomposed network resources in places where power and space are constrained. Below key trends has driven the evolution of our routing portfolio with software capabilities and compact form-factors. As we look to the future, the trends will require even more accelerated innovation.

## Need for architecture transistions

In past CSPs used to build siloed networks for their mobile, enterprise and residential networks. But this is not helping the CSPs to maintain their networks efficiently. They need to move to a single transport network which allows them to move to faster service delivery. The C[onverged Transport architecture](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/service-provider/converged-sdn-transport/at-a-glance-c45-744218.html) uses advanced features and technology to help CSPs design and migrate to a network prepared to scale to meet the stringent bandwidth and performance demands of their customers. At the fundamental level, the Converged SDN Transport architecture drives simplification into the CSPâ€™s network and operations.

Implementing the Converged SDN Transport architecture will allow CSPs to realize the following business benefits:

- Reduced operational complexity for network management
- Increased revenue with a service-focused, service-centric network
- Improved time to market for new value-added services
- Optimized utilization of fiber capacity
- Decreased operational and capital expenditures associated with the network


## Evolved Metro Use cases

Below are some of the use cases which we see will drive the evolution of the metro architecture as well as the products.

## NCS5500/5700 Portfolio Evolution for supporting the converged metro

The Cisco [NCS 5500/5700](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/routers/network-convergence-system-5500-series/index.html) Series is an industry-leading portfolio developed to handle massive traffic growth. It is designed for operational simplicity and to efficiently meet the scaling needs of large enterprises, web, Utilities and service providers. It has a range of products from fixed platforms (1RU,2RU,3RU) to Modular Chassis (4,8,16 slots).
