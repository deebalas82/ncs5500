## Introduction

As per [Cisco's Annual Internet Report](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/executive-perspectives/annual-internet-report/white-paper-c11-741490.html), the number of devices connected to IP networks will be more than three times the global population by 2023. There will be 3.6 networked devices per capita by 2023, up from 2.4 networked devices per capita in 2018. There will be 29.3 billion networked devices by 2023, up from 18.4 billion in 2018. As per Gartner, by 2025 more than 75% of the computing data needs to be analyzed, processed, and stored near to the end users. New paradigms such as 5G introduction, video traffic continuous growth, IoT proliferation and cloud services model require unprecedented flexibility, elasticity and scale from the network. Increasing bandwidth demands and decreasing ARPU put pressure on reducing network cost. At the same time, services need to be deployed faster and more cost effectively to stay competitive. The metro network becomes the key to this transformation where we see services getting terminated and end users are looking for better experiences.
