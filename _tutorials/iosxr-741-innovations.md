## New Features in IOS XR 7.4.1

We asked a few colleagues to help documenting the new improvements brought by the 7.3.1 version. It will be split in software innovations on one side (Segment Routing, SRv6, EVPN, Multicast, QoS, Security, ...) and new supported hardware (chassis, power supply, new line cards and new fixed-form-factor products).

### ACL

Tejas Lad demonstrates the improvements brought by J2 ASIC for egress ACL and statistics.

.

With Jericho2 platforms, a series of limitations present in Jericho/Jericho+ have been lifted, for example:  
- We don't need to use a specific hardware module profile configuration to allocate counters for ACL permit packets. "hw-module profile stats acl-permit" is not used anymore.  
- In Jericho and Qumran-MX platforms with NL12k eTCAM, it could be necessary to recarve the resource with "hw-module profile  tcam acl-prefix percent <0-100>". It's all dynamic on Jericho+ with OP and Jericho2 with OP2 eTCAMs, no config is needed
- We don't recycle packets for ACLv6 in egress direction like it was the case in Jericho and Jericho+ platforms, the packet treatment with J2 is done in one pass.
- We support egress ACLv6 on BVI interfaces, something not supported on J/J+ platforms.

Tejas also published another article here with plenty of details:  
[https://xrdocs.io/ncs5500/tutorials/access-list-enhancements-on-ncs5500-j2-based-platforms/](https://xrdocs.io/ncs5500/tutorials/access-list-enhancements-on-ncs5500-j2-based-platforms/)

In IOS XR 7.4.1, we complete this list of improvements with more fields.

### Security

Rakesh Kandula presented new security feature: Chip Guard on NCS540.  

<iframe class="responsive" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2fwIZRRJPSw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>{: .align-center}  
.

Let's first describe two essential components into every IOS XR router:  
- TAm: the Trust Anchor module chip integrated in all recent device
- Cisco Secure Boot: the chain ensuring the integrity of the entire boot process

![Secure-boot-process.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Secure-boot-process.png){: .align-center}

Also these components are not enough if the hardware itself has been replaced by malware infected parts (CPU or NPU). And that's the purpose of this new feature: Chip Guard introduced now in our access platforms: NCS540.

Chip Guard feature is triggered during the BIOS part of the boot sequence.  

![Manufacturing-diag-process.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Manufacturing-diag-process.png){: .align-center}

![ImprintDB.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/ImprintDB.png){: .align-center}
During manufacturing:
- the SHA-256 hash of the Electronic Chip ID (ECID) of the CPU and NPU are calculated
- These hashes are then programmed inside the TAm chip
- The programmed hash values form the ImprintDB inside the TAm chip
- The ImprintDB cannot be modified during runtime

When the router boots:  

![Step1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Step1.png){: .align-center}

- BIOS reads the ECID of the chips and computes their hashes
- Each of the hashes is then extended into a PCR inside TAm chip
- These set of observed hashes forms the ObserveDB

![Step2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Step2.png){: .align-center}

- BIOS fetches the factory programmed hash values from imprintDB
- The hash values are compared with the ObserveDB generated in the previous step
- BIOS continues with boot process if and only if the hashes match

### QoS

Paban Sarma introduces PPS-based policer for DNX platforms (NCS500 / NCS5500).  

<iframe class="responsive" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xUFR_DVV1bo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>{: .align-center}  
.

Before the introduction of this feature, we used absolute values in bps for policer rate and burst in bytes or unit of time:

<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight">
<code>policy-map police-bps
 class class-default
  police rate 10 mpbs burst 12 kbytes
  !
 !
 end-policy-map
!</code>
</pre>
</div>

Or we can use relative units (percent):

<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight">
<code>policy-map police-percent
 class class-default
  police rate percent 1 burst 2 ms
  !
 !
 end-policy-map
!</code>
</pre>
</div>

Starting in IOS XR 7.4.1, we can use absolute units of PPS and burst expressed in number of packets.

<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight">
<code>policy-map police-pps
 class class-default
  police rate 1000 pps burst 2000 packets
  !
 !
 end-policy-map
!

RP/0/RP0/CPU0:NCS-55A1-24Q6H-2#show  qos interface  tenGigE 0/0/0/1.1 input

NOTE:- Configured values are displayed within parentheses
Interface TenGigE0/0/0/1.1 ifh 0x8022  -- input policy
NPU Id:                        0
Total number of classes:       1
Interface Bandwidth:           10000000 kbps
Policy Name:                   police-pps
SPI Id:                        0x0
Accounting Type:               Layer2 (Include Layer 2 encapsulation and above)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level1 Class                             =   class-default

Policer Bucket ID                        =   0x100
Policer Stats Handle                     =   0x0
Policer committed rate                   =   998 kbps (<mark>1000 packets/sec</mark>)
Policer conform burst                    =   256000 bytes (<mark>2000 packets</mark>)</code>
</pre>
</div>

With this approach, the policer behaves regardless of the size of the packets handled by the policy.  
Min and max configurable values are 100 pps and 66,000,000 pps respectively.  
Burst size to be defined in packets PPS and BPS may coexist in a Flat Policy. PPS and BPS canâ€™t coexist in an Hierarchical policy.

### BFD

Tejas Lad presents the BoB-BLB co-existence benefits.  

<iframe class="responsive" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/60Kuy1NY6JA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>{: .align-center}  
.

In IOS XR 7.4.1, we introduce the action of both BoB and BLB simultaneously on the same bundle for faster convergence. All technical details can be found in this dedicated article:

### New NCS560 IMA and 4x10G support

Paban Sarma introduces the new IMA and the partial 4x10G mode for NCS560:

<iframe class="responsive" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NUEAc8gPP-0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>{: .align-center}  
.

IOS XR 7.4.1 is used as the vehicule to introduce the support of a new IMA for NCS560 series (4-slot or 7-slot): N560-IMA-N560-IMA-8Q/4L

![new-IMA.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/new-IMA.png){: .align-center}

Cisco NCS 560 Series Routers Interface Modules Data Sheet:  
[https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/routers/network-convergence-system-560-series-routers/datasheet-c78-740295.html](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/routers/network-convergence-system-560-series-routers/datasheet-c78-740295.html)

8 ports split in two "QUADs" (groups of 4 contiguous ports):
- QUAD-1: port 0-3
- QUAD-2: port 4-7

You can configure these QUAD in a specific mode (by default, it's 25G) and the four ports of the group will be configured in the same mode:  
- all four ports 10GE
- all four ports 25GE
- one port on two at 50G

So, it's possible to use these ports in various combinations:  
- 8x 10G
- 4x 10G + 4x 25G (or vice versa)
- 4x 10G + 2x 50G (or vice versa)
- 4x 25G + 2x 50G (or vice versa)
- 8x 25G
- 4x 50G

Note1: that configuring a port in 50G mode is only supported in the even-numbered port and it disables the N+1 port.

Note2: in 10G mode, we don't support 1G insertion either

Also introduced in IOS XR 7.4.1, the support of "Partial" 4x10G to support the insertion of N560-IMA-8Z(-L) in 40Gbps slots.  
Before 7.4.1, these IMA were only supported in the 80+Gbps slots: 4, 5, 7, 9, 10 and 11:

![560-7.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/560-7.png){: .align-center}

Now, it's possible to insert the IMA in 40Gbps slots (2, 3, 12 and 13) and support half of the ports (and which ports will be disabled is dependent on the type of IMA):
