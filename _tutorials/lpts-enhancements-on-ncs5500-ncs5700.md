## Introduction

In our previous article, we had introduced the [LPTS architecture](https://xrdocs.io/ncs5500/tutorials/introduction-to-ncs55xx-and-ncs5xx-lpts/) on NCS5500 and NCS500 product family. There we introduced the concept of LPTS and its internal architecture. We also saw with examples how LPTS entries are created in the hardware and how they can be altered as per different requirements. We then followed it up with introduction to [Domain based LPTS Policers](https://xrdocs.io/ncs5500/tutorials/ncs55x-and-ncs5xx-domain-based-lpts-policers/) and understanding its use cases. In this article, we will discuss the LPTS latest enhancements on the newer generation products.
