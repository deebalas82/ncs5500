## NCS5700 and the Jericho2 NPU

The NCS5500 products series is composed of different routing devices, fixed port "pizza boxes" and modular chassis with line cards. To identify more clearly the products based on Broadcom Jericho2 ASICs, we named the fixed platforms "NCS57xx" and the line cards in the chassis "NC57-xx". It's also the case for J2C platforms.
